The most recent addition to this file is always on top and has the highest
item number.

12. November 7, 2005

- Added Database::DropEvent(const std::string&) to drop interest in a previously
registered event (using Database::DefineEvent()).

- Cleaned some details of the current Events handling implementation such that
false shadow counts are not reported when re-defining events after having dropped
them.

11. September 27, 2005

- Again, huge editing, this time to simplify and revert to 'int' a lot of places
where int32_t had been declared in the previous step and which are not needed. It is
better to declare the interface using simple int where possible and use only specific
size integers where needed for portability reasons between 32 and 64 bits systems.
By the way, just a reminder : 16 bits systems are NOT supported by IBPP.

- Changed the date / time / timestamp support in order to get access to the sub-second
precision, which is defined in ten thousandths of seconds in IB and FB.
The operator int() has been dropped and replaced by methods GetDate() and GetTime().
The method GetTime() can take an optional fourth parameter to get the sub-seconds.
Same for method SetTime(). This is true for classes Time and Timestamp.

- Added int Statement::GetSubtype(int) returning, for a Blob column only, the subtype
of the Blob as it is declared in the database metadata.


10. September 23, 2005

- Huge but simple code editing occured over all the source code base to
correctly support LP64 and LLP64 models on 64 bits environments. Good news is
that this only relies on using the C 99 standard exact precision integer types
int16_t, int32_t and int64_t (int64_t had already been introduced in the source
earlier).

9. September 12, 2005

- The official way to build IBPP on Windows using Borland, Microsoft and Digital
Mars compilers has changed. Previously the HOWTOBUILD.TXT files recommended to
download and install MSYS. This is not required anymore though still applicable.
All you need to do is to get a Win32 native port of GNU MAKE and SH. See the
HOWTOBUILD.TXT file for details. This is easier / lighter and helps keep a
single Makefile valid for all supported platforms, until some more complex
configuration like eventually bakefiles start to be used. Really this is not
so new. It has been a looong time that you could build IBPP that way, I just
decided that it was a more simple / straighforward default procedure.

- Note regarding MSVC. For building with MSVC 6, you have to proceed as
described in HOWTOBUILD.TXT (using gnu make). No visual project is provided
for MSVC 6 and no such will be provided. (Because it would then have to be
maintained). For building with MSVC 7.1, you have two options. The Makefile
way (as for MSVC 6) or the visual way using the provided ibpp.sln solution file.
This solution file will be maintained (because _I_ use that method so can
commit myself to maintain / support it).


8. September 10, 2005

- A lot of small details changed in the implementation of various internals
methods, as to stop using C++ exceptions in some specific cases. This makes for
a cleaner design and better experience when running under debugger control.
Thanks to Michael Hieke and some others for insisting on this.


7. August 30, 2005

- Added void ClientLibSearchPaths(const std::string&);
On Win32 platform, ClientLibSearchPaths() allows to setup one or multiple 
additional paths (separated with a ';') where IBPP will look for the client 
library (before the default implicit search locations). This is usefull for 
applications distributed with a 'private' copy of Firebird, when the registry 
is useless to identify the location from where to attempt loading the 
fbclient.dll / gds32.dll. If called, this function must be called *early* by 
the application, before *any* other function or object methods of IBPP. This 
is currently a NO-OP on platforms other than Win32.


6. February 13, 2005

- Added methods Save(const std::string&) and Load(std::string) to class Blob.
Those methods allow to easily read and write a full blob using a std::string.
A Save(), is the equivalent of Create(), a loop of Write(), and Close().
A Load(), is the equivalent of Open(), a loop of Read(), and Close().

- Extended the Statement::Set() and Statement::Get() in regards to blobs and
std::string. Now one can directly Get(3, str) where str is a std::string and
the column at hands is a blob. The blob is retrieved and stored to the string.
The reverse is true for Set(3, str) where str is a std::string. It will be
stored directly. For simple case useages, this allows to bypass the useage of
any IBPP::Blob intermediate objects and, unless finer control is required
(which Create/Open/Write/Read/Close offer), it it much simpler to use blobs
from application code.

- Statement::Get when acting on std::string type and on a SQL CHAR or VARCHAR)
has been streamlined a bit to remove an unnecessary std::string copy. The string
read is now being directly copied from the FB client buffer to the user
std::string variable. Might have a minor impact on heavy string I/O.


5. December 9, 2004, 18:00 GMT+1

- Change in the interface definition of methods using or returning 64 bits
integers. The ibpp.h now uses the C99 standard (section 7.18) types which are
defined by including the stdint.h header. This is perfectly fine using all
compilers on which IBPP is maintained, except for one. Guess which one ? Yes,
MSVC does not supply that header nor those typedefs in any other file. The
solution is simple, ibpp.h does a typedef __int64 int64_t in case of the MSVC
compilers.


4. November 6, 2004, 14:15 GMT+1

- Added bool Row::Updated(). Returns wether any column of the row was updated
(wether Set() was called at least one time on one of the columns).

- Added bool Row::ColumnUpdated(int). Returns wether a specific column was
updated.


3. November 6, 2004, 11:45 GMT+1 --- Experiment in progress in CVS HEAD

- There is a new object named IBPP::Row. The internal XSDA class has been
merged in the new Row/IRow/RowImpl class. There is no RowFactory(). The only
way to get a Row is through Statement::Fetch(Row&).

For now, this Row thing is not very interesting in itself. It seems only to
duplicate what is already available through Statement methods. Instead of
writing something like:

	while (st->Fetch())
	{
		st->Get(1, ...);
		...
	}

we can now (optionally) write:

	IBPP::Row r;
	while (st->Fetch(r))
	{
		r->Get(1, ...);
		...
	}

The Statement implementation itself has been revised to share code and uses
an internal Row to implement the Set/Get methods and some others.

One of the goals behind this IBPP:Row is to ease the writing of client side
caches of result sets by the application programmers. It is conceptually much
more easy to cache a list of rows than a list of lists of individual columns.
Note that at the present time, the current Row interface might not yet be
sufficient to achieve this goal perfectly. Interfaces changes will probably
occur in the next days.

But there are also more goals behind this one. Stay tuned.

!! The code compiles and runs and should not bring any semantic differences to
existing applications (as the full Statement interface is maintained). For some
days though (while we test it extensively at TIP Group), there could some bugs
lurking in the dark. We therefore recommend people not to use HEAD code for
anything than tests until further notice. !!


2. November 4, 2004 --- Exception revision

- Exception handling revision. The current code compiles with MSVC7.1. Other
compilers / platform to be tested. There is now IBPP::Exception as a base class.
SQLException specialization is thrown as result of an engine reported runtime
error. LogicException specialization is thrown in all other cases.

                    std::exception
                           |
                   IBPP::Exception
                 /                 \
    IBPP::LogicException    IBPP::SQLException


1. October 27, 2004 --- BUG FIX RELEASE 2.3.5.0

The HEAD code is synched with the branch 'rel_2_3' after the 2.3.5.0 release.
